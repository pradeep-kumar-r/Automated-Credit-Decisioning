# Model the approval process to create automated credit decisioning (underwriting) system

ABC Payments Bank is a mobile-only bank. Their primary business is to give out digital credit cards to eligible users with a credit limit ranging from $1000 to $8000 all over the world. These digital credit cards are issued within an hour after filling up a form in the Bank’s Mobile App called DigiCard.

This product provides a very good revenue to the banks, however, it’s a challenging task for them to decide who should they approve for the card and who to reject. You have to help this bank decide how can they confidently take this decision based on the experience they had in the past. 
 
Using the attached dataset which contains historical data about bank’s old customers, the problem has two primary goals: 
1. Whom to approve or reject for the credit card? 
2. How much credit limit to give if approved?
